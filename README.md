# Talon

This is a programming language, compiler, and runtime for creating text adventures. It's a work in progress.

![Current Build](https://github.com/Norhaven/Talon/actions/workflows/ci-build.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)

# Developing

After you clone the repo, run `npm install` at the root to acquire the necessary packages. Build/Run configurations are already set up for VS Code, so I would recommend using that. Just open the root folder with it to get started.

# Running

Using VS Code, use the `Launch Chrome against localhost` run/debug option. This will build the project and open a browser window with the rudimentary IDE that you can use to play around with.

# Contributing

If you feel so inclined, please reach out to me to find the best way to contribute. As this becomes a more fully formed project, issues with contribution-friendly tags may show up. For now, though, I'll be happy to hear from you.
